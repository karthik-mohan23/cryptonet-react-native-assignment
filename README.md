# ReactNative-ThreeJS-WalkingCharacter

**Description:**
This React Native app utilizes Expo and React Three Fiber to create a simple mobile application that displays a 3D model of a walking character using the Three.js library.

## New Features:

- **File Download and Animation:**
  The app now supports downloading a 3D model file from a specified URL using Expo file storage. The downloaded file is then used to animate the walking character, enhancing the interactive experience.
